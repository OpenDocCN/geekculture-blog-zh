Multiuser VR. The blue person is here explaining to the four attendees of this VR presentation some aspects of the protein structure his group developed (cartoons in the center of the scene). All participants can freely move around the VR hall, and each can manipulate the protein structures one at a time to move or scale them at will -which all other participants see happening in real time. This and all other figures, tweets and videos shown in this article were produced by the authors from their own software.
