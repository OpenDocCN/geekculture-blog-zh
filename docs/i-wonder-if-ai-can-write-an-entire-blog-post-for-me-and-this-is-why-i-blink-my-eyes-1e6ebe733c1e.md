# 我们有很多活动，需要一个救生员。AI 能拯救我们吗？

我说的还是辅助我们写作的 AI。在我支付了 Conversion.ai 来测试它之后，我将尝试下一个——TextCortext。

它为我们提供了一些工具。幸运的是，它有一个博客文章生成工具。好吧，我会用这个帖子的标题让它为我写，这是结果。

in Morse Code Morse Code is a system for sending and receiving messages in the form of long and short flashes of light. It was originally designed for use by and with telegraphs, but is now mainly used by amateur radio operators. [I Wonder if AI Can Write an Entire Blog Post for Me and This Is Why I Blink My Eyes in Morse Code] The original Morse code was developed in 1836 by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, and was first implemented on the line between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. It used only straight taps and did not allow for spacing or punctuation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the code was shortened to allow for quicker transmission. The original version was retained as a sort of “emergency” code for use in the event of a telegraph line outage or a telegraph operator being incapacitated. In the 1930s, a version of Morse code was developed that used dots and dashes of equal length. This was a great improvement on the original version, as it allowed for both punctuation and spaces.

当我试图生成更多时，它说我需要升级，因为我的点数用完了。在此之前，你能发誓这是我标题的博文吗？好吧，我要升级看看它能做什么。

我升级并尝试了一个不同的标题。

```
I want to be a writer
```

这就是结果。

You’ll have more time to experiment with different writing projects and see if you enjoy it. This can be especially beneficial if you want to become a freelance writer. Try to find a job within your field If you want to get a job in your field of study, it can be a good idea to get some work experience under your belt. This will help you stand out to future employers. You can do this while you’re still in school, or you can take a year off to work in your field. You can get a job in a related field or find a part-time job that will give you some experience in your desired field.

首先，你需要知道它每次只生成 100 个单词。这篇文章的长度是三次点击“进一步扩展文章”按钮的结果。

你注意到什么了吗？

它使用给定的标题开始第一句话，并总是以动词结尾。

让我再检查一下旧标题，如果升级后会更明智。

嗯。我感觉就像看到一个坠毁的机器人在最后时刻试图说些什么。Conversion.ai 也有类似的工具，但它的标题有 80 个字母的限制。然后，我将尝试查看“我不知道人工智能能否为我写一整篇博文”的输出

If you’re anything like me, the thought of having to write a blog post scares the bejesus out of you. You sit there trying to come up with an idea that will entertain your readers and finally give up; not because you couldn’t think of something but because it was too much work. I know this is a problem for many writers so I wanted to introduce AI Writer — artificial intelligence software that can take care of all your blog writing needs! This software gives you access to thousands upon thousands of pre-written articles at the click of a button. No more writer’s block or wasted time on research when what really matters is getting those creative juices flowing again! Just fill in some blanks and let AI do

AI has been in the news a lot recently. It seems like every week there’s a new article speculating on how artificial intelligence will change our lives. Some people are freaking out and others seem pretty chill about it, but I’m not sure either of those reactions is really warranted. The truth is that no one knows what the future holds for us, and frankly AI could be really awesome or really terrible — we just don’t know yet. What do you think?

I’m a writer. I wonder if AI can write an entire blog post for me? I don’t know, but it’s worth a try!

为了公平起见，我将对 TextCortext 使用相同的标题。在这里。

but I’ve seen it do some amazing things. AI has the potential to change so many things about how we live. I don’t know how much it would cost, but I would love to have an AI assistant to help me with my work. We may not have to worry about climate change as much, because AI can figure out how to solve the problem. AI is going to change the economy in ways we cannot imagine.

我明白了，TextCortext 可以以任何东西结尾。有了一个简短而清晰的标题，它工作得更好，但仍然不能使用。Conversion.ai 效果更好。即使它不符合我的意图，我们也可以用它来做另一个话题。

我觉得 TextCortext 还有很长的路要走，尤其是生成产品描述。它只需要产品名称和产品类别，结果是…让我们看看 iPhone 99 的描述。

# 描述 1

```
iPhone 6s Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, iPhone 6 Plus case, Apple iPhone 6 Plus case, Apple iPhone 6 Plus case, Apple iPhone 6 Plus case
```

# 描述 2

```
This stylish and trendy case is the perfect way to show off your iPhone. The case is made from high quality durable ABS plastic and rubber with a matte finish. The case has a smooth surface for a comfortable grip. All buttons and ports are easily accessible. The case can be completely hinged at the back. This is a perfect case for those who want to add some flair to their phone and at the same time protect it.
```

# 描述 3

```
Protect and personalize your iPhone 4/4s with this stylish and sleek 3D case. This case provides ultimate protection from scratches and its perfect mold keeps the phone trim and trendy. Reinforced with hard plastic to the sides to ensure the durability of the case. Precise openings on the protector case to allow access to all controls and features on the phone. Packed in high quality poly bag packing.
```

# 描述 4

```
This is a universal / Apple iPhone 4 / 4S case, which is made of eco-friendly plastic material, with good sense of touch, fashion and special material, it is used to make your iPhone 4 / 4S more beautiful and unique.
```

对于这些结果我只能说一句，可怕！AI 需要的条件越少，你就越可怕。Conversion.ai 需要产品名称和我们自己的描述才能开始工作。不敢相信 TextCortext 是付费工具。我想知道我的产品是否缺乏文字，然后我将它扩展到“iPhone 99 最新的智能手机”，但它的描述仍然是试图销售 iPhone 外壳和 iPhone4s/4。我能看出你的能力。

再见 TextCortext。

# 结论

像聊天机器人一样，人工智能是一种预测游戏。开发人员必须预测用户的输入并准备响应。区别在于复杂度和用法。我们可能需要一百万行代码来完善它，但没有什么是不可能的。Converion.ai 向我们展示了成功的曙光。它有潜力为我们写一整篇博文。帮助学生做作业的人工智能可能是下一个。

嗯，在未来，这将是一个新的标准，我们可能需要一个新的专业的反人工智能开发者，用另一套人工智能来检查学生的作业。

你准备好迎接下一个时代了吗？
